## Claude Code Optimization & Project Management

### Project File Management Strategy
**CRITICAL**: Claude Code must save this specification as a project reference to prevent context window loss and ensure consistent development.

### Required Project Files Structure
```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md                 # Complete specification (THIS FILE)
├── README.md                 # User-facing documentation
├── DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md     # Current phase tracking
├── TESTING_CHECKLIST.md      # Quality gates and test requirements
├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md      # API endpoints and integration details
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md       # Hosting and deployment instructions
└── .claude/
    ├── project-context.json  # Project state and metadata
    ├── current-phase.md      # Active development phase
    ├── completed-tasks.md    # Finished development steps
    └── next-actions.md       # Upcoming development priorities
```

### Opening Instructions for Claude Code
```markdown
# CLAUDE CODE PROJECT INITIALIZATION

## FIRST ACTION REQUIRED
Before starting ANY development work:

1. **SAVE THIS SPECIFICATION**: Copy this entire document to `CLAUDE.md` in project root
2. **CREATE PROJECT STRUCTURE**: Set up the required file structure above
3. **INITIALIZE TRACKING**: Create phase tracking in `.claude/current-phase.md`
4. **VALIDATE SETUP**: Confirm all project files are created and accessible

## CONTEXT PRESERVATION STRATEGY
- **ALWAYS** reference `CLAUDE.md` for complete project understanding
- **UPDATE** `.claude/current-phase.md` after completing each development step
- **MAINTAIN** `.claude/completed-tasks.md` with finished work
- **DOCUMENT** any specification changes or discoveries in project files

## TOKEN EFFICIENCY PRINCIPLES
- Reference saved files instead of re-explaining requirements
- Use incremental development with clear phase boundaries
- Maintain project state in files, not just context window
- Build modular components that can be developed independently
```

### Token Optimization Strategies

#### Context Window Management
```
Efficient Development Pattern:
├── Start session: "Continue Phase 2, Step 2.1 from CLAUDE.md"
├── Reference: Check .claude/current-phase.md for exact progress
├── Build: Focus only on current step requirements
├── Document: Update completion status in project files
└── End session: Save progress and next actions clearly

Avoid Token Waste:
├── Never re-explain full project scope in new sessions
├── Don't rebuild understanding from scratch each time
├── Reference existing code and documentation
├── Use file-based state management instead of conversation memory
└── Break complex features into discrete, documentable steps
```

#### Modular Development Strategy
```
Component Isolation:
├── Each component has clear input/output contracts
├── Components can be built and tested independently
├── Integration points are well-documented
├── Reusable patterns are documented for future use
└── Dependencies are explicit and minimal

Development Session Efficiency:
├── Single responsibility per session
├── Clear success criteria with file-based validation
├── Incremental progress that builds on previous work
├── Comprehensive documentation of decisions and trade-offs
└── Prepared next-actions for following sessions
```
[Specific guidance for effective development]
```

### 6. Session Management

## Claude Code Implementation Strategy

### Critical Build Principles
1. **One Phase at a Time**: Never try to build multiple phases simultaneously
2. **Validate Before Proceeding**: Each step must work before moving to next
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Add one feature per development session
4. **Test Early**: Validate core functionality before adding features
5. **Error Handling First**: Build error states before happy path features

### Recommended Development Session Structure
```
Session Goal: [Specific step from above]
Success Criteria: [Exact validation requirement]
Max Scope: [Single step only]
Next Session: [Following step]
```

### Common Claude Code Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to one step per session
- **Missing Dependencies**: Install packages before using them
- **Skip Validation**: Always test each step works
- **Complex State**: Keep state management simple initially
- **Premature Optimization**: Focus on working before optimizing

This phased approach ensures Claude Code can build successfully without getting overwhelmed or confused about priorities.
